<h2>they don't look like much but are tasty and use BEER</h2>

<p>
    Fun to experiment with. I agree with the reviews that the all purpose flour makes the dough too thin.  <br>
    By happy accident, I'd substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour, since I'd run out of all purpose -- what a difference. <br>
     I used a microbrew and folded in dried cranberries for more flavor (per another suggestion posted).  <br>
     This is a savory cookie if the recipe is followed, not sweet. However, I've done a variation where  <br>
     I used the "sweeter" Guinness stout and folded in chocolate chips.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
2 cups all-purpose flour
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ cup butter
1 ¼ cups room temperature beer
½ cup chopped walnuts
</ul>

<ol>
1.Cream together the butter or margarine and the brown sugar. Cut in flour, baking soda and spice. Blend in beer to make a dough.
2.Drop by teaspoonfuls and top with a walnut piece.
3.Bake 12-15 minutes at a 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven until lightly brown. Cool one minute on cookie sheet and remove to wire rack.
</ol>
