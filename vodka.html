    No ice cream maker? Pour the mixture into a container, cover it, and place it in the freezer. When it is semi-solid, mash it up with a fork and refreeze it again. Once frozen, place it in a food processor or blender and process until smooth. Cover and refreeze until ready to serve.
    You will need the zest from the lemon to give the sorbet the best lemon flavor. A fine grater or a zester works best. If you don't have one of those tools, you could use a vegetable peeler to get strips of zest, then use a chef's knife to finely mince it.
    You will get more lemon juice from a lemon if it is at room temperature before squeezing.
